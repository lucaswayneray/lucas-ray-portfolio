##  Introduction

* Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.
* Course focuses on basic programming concepts using Python 3.

## Chapter 1 ‚Äì Why Program?

* Programming = telling the computer what to do.
* Python is beginner-friendly and widely used in data science, automation, and web development.

###  Key Concepts

* Programming is problem solving.
* Code executes line-by-line.
* A "program" is a sequence of instructions.
* Computers want to be helpful.
* A program is a sequence of stored instructions.
* The CPU is the closest thing a computer has to intelligence‚Äîvery fast but not actually smart.
* Instructions are electrical impulses fetched and executed by the CPU from memory (Fetch/Execute Cycle).
* Main memory (RAM): temporary, fast storage; wiped on shutdown.
* Secondary memory: permanent storage like hard drives or USB sticks.

###  Hardware Components

* **CPU** ‚Äì Runs the program; fetches instructions from memory and executes them.
* **Input Devices** ‚Äì Keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, etc.
* **Output Devices** ‚Äì Monitor, speakers, printer, DVD burner.
* **Main Memory (RAM)** ‚Äì Fast, small, temporary storage. Data lost on reboot.
* **Secondary Memory** ‚Äì Slower, large, permanent storage. Holds data until explicitly deleted.
