## Module 1: Introduction to Agile and Scrum

### Scrum Master vs. Project Manager

Unlike project managers, a Scrum Master does not plan the overall project from start to finish, manage budgets, control risks, or procure material. Scrum Masters lead teams, remove roadblocks, participate in the planning process for the team's work, and help the team work together. The various steps in the Sprint process are Sprint Planning 1 and 2, Sprint, Review, or Demo, and Retrospective. Scrum Masters are coaches and servant leaders who lead by example. A Scrum Master knows how to set realistic goals and achieve them, understands the capabilities of the team, and knows how to drill down when clarity is needed. The most important skill a Scrum Master must pursue is to become an effective communicator. Scrum Masters ensure the team stays organized, focused, and on track to satisfy the goals of the Sprint. Scrum Masters act as a bridge between management and the team, ensuring the team is not distracted from its primary tasks. Scrum Masters ensure impediments and blockers are identified early and do all they can to resolve them. Scrum Masters support the teams and motivate them to perform at the highest levels. Scrum Masters serve in a number of adaptive methodologies to include Scrum-like Extreme Programming, or XP, Scaled Agile Framework, or SAFe, Kanban, Dynamic Systems Development Method, or DSDM, Crystal, and Lean Software Development.

* **Scrum Master** is **not** a Project Manager
* Scrum Masters:

  * Act as **coaches**, **facilitators**, and **servant leaders**
  * Lead teams, remove roadblocks, improve processes
  * Do **not** manage budgets, procurement, or full project timelines

### Responsibilities of a Scrum Master

**Knowledge Check: Scrum Master Responsibilities**

* **Scrum Master works collaboratively to resolve blockers**: A core responsibility. The Scrum Master collaborates with team members, the Product Owner, and external stakeholders to eliminate impediments.

* **Team members update the Kanban board**: While not specific to Scrum, Kanban boards are often used by Scrum teams. It is the responsibility of the team members to keep these boards current.

* **The Sprint may be extended if required**: False. Sprints are strictly time-boxed and must not be extended.

* **Conflicts are addressed during the daily stand-up meeting**: False. The Daily Scrum is for planning the next 24 hours, not for conflict resolution. Conflicts should be addressed outside the stand-up.

* **Coach:**

  * Removes impediments
  * Promotes a healthy, collaborative team environment

* **Facilitator:**

  * Leads Scrum events (Sprint Planning, Reviews, Retrospectives)
  * Tracks and collects team metrics
  * Aligns team to Product Owner’s vision

* **Servant Leader:**

  * Puts team’s needs first
  * Empowers teams to self-organize
  * Supports growth and continuous improvement

### Scrum Process Summary

**Knowledge Check: Measuring Work for a Sprint**

* In practice, **Capacity** is the best term to describe how much work the team can take on during a Sprint based on availability and bandwidth.
* However, many quizzes and certifications may expect the answer **Velocity**, which measures **how much work was completed in past Sprints**.
* Velocity is often used to help forecast team capacity, which may explain the confusion in assessment contexts.

**Knowledge Check: Common Scrum Event Term**

* Scrum refers to key events like Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Review, and Retrospective as **Ceremonies**.
* These ceremonies provide regular rhythm and structure to the team’s workflow.

**Knowledge Check: Final Event of the Sprint**

* The final event a Scrum Master must facilitate at the end of each Sprint is the **Sprint Retrospective**.
* The Retrospective occurs **after the Sprint Review (Demo)** and focuses on improving team processes and collaboration.
* Its purpose is to inspect how the Sprint went and identify areas for improvement before the next Sprint begins.
* This is distinct from a "Lessons Learned" session, which is a traditional project management term and not part of Scrum.

* The final event a Scrum Master must facilitate at the end of each Sprint is the **Sprint Retrospective**.

* The Retrospective occurs **after the Sprint Review (Demo)** and focuses on improving team processes and collaboration.

* Its purpose is to inspect how the Sprint went and identify areas for improvement before the next Sprint begins.

* This is distinct from a "Lessons Learned" session, which is a traditional project management term and not part of Scrum.

* **Sprint Planning (Part 1):**

  * Team selects user stories from Product Backlog
  * Scrum Master ensures participation and clarity
  * Product Owner defines needs and acceptance criteria

* **Sprint Planning (Part 2):**

  * Team creates Sprint Backlog (tasks for selected stories)
  * Scrum Master facilitates task assignments and ensures collaboration

* **Daily Scrum:**

  * Short daily check-in
  * Scrum Master ensures blockers are addressed

* **Sprint Review / Demo:**

  * Team presents the working product increment
  * Scrum Master prepares team and Product Owner for demo
  * Feedback is collected

* **Sprint Retrospective:**

  * Team reflects on what went well and what to improve
  * Scrum Master ensures actionable improvements are agreed upon

### Key Attributes of an Effective Scrum Master

* **Inspires adherence to Scrum values**
* **Removes blockers** and prevents external interference
* **Facilitates collaboration** among team and stakeholders
* **Promotes transparency, inspection, and adaptation**
* **Leads through influence, not authority**

### Scrum Master Skill Inventory

**Core Roles of a Scrum Master – Knowledge Check**

* Two of the primary roles a Scrum Master must excel at are:

     **Coaching:** Guides the team in Agile/Scrum principles, fosters self-organization, and supports team growth and learning.

  * Facilitation: Leads Scrum events effectively, ensures smooth collaboration, and helps remove impediments.
  * Prioritization is owned by the **Product Owner**, and deep technical expertise is not required of a Scrum Master.

* Deep understanding of the **Scrum Guide**

* **Servant leadership:** encourages development, communication, and shared responsibility

* **Effective communicator:** builds trust, shields team from distractions

* **Change agent:** drives process improvement and adaptation

* **Coach:** enables others to take on the Scrum Master role

* **Conflict management & negotiation skills**

* Supports Product Owner in backlog refinement and stakeholder collaboration

### Important Scrum Concepts

**Knowledge Check: Product Backlog Refinement**

* The **Product Owner** is responsible for reviewing and updating the **Product Backlog** to ensure all **User Stories are ready** for the next Sprint.
* This formal process is called **Refinement**.
* While the Scrum Master may facilitate refinement meetings, the Product Owner owns the backlog content and its prioritization.

**Knowledge Check: Definition of Done**

* The term generally used in Scrum to describe an increment that was completed as planned and accepted by a customer is **Done**.
* "Done" means that the increment meets the team's **Definition of Done**, which includes all agreed-upon criteria such as coding, testing, documentation, and stakeholder acceptance.
* Terms like "finished," "complete," or "satisfied" are not formally recognized in Scrum and lack the rigor of a clearly defined "Done."

**Knowledge Check: Product Backlog Responsibility**

* The Scrum Master assists in ensuring the Product Backlog is accurate and that all User Stories are ready for the Sprint.

* However, the **Product Owner** has the **primary responsibility** to ensure the Product Backlog is complete, prioritized, and refined.

* The Product Owner owns the backlog content, defines acceptance criteria, and ensures that stories are well-prepared for implementation.

* The Scrum Master supports this process through facilitation and coaching but is not the owner of the backlog.

* **Minimum Viable Product (MVP):** basic version that satisfies user story acceptance criteria

* **Increment:** usable product outcome from a sprint

* **Definition of Done:** all criteria met and accepted by the customer

* **Empirical Process Control:**

  * **Transparency:** all relevant info is visible to stakeholders
  * **Inspection:** info is reviewed via boards, charts, and demos
  * **Adaptation:** changes are made based on feedback and insights

## Adaptive Agile Methodologies

**Knowledge Check: Work in Progress Limits**

* A Scrum Master implementing an adaptive methodology that uses **Work in Progress (WIP) limitations** is using **Kanban**.
* Kanban limits how many tasks can be in each stage at a time, helping distribute work evenly and prevent exceeding team capacity.
* Other frameworks (XP, Crystal, Lean) do not feature WIP limits as a core principle.

**Knowledge Check: Most Widely Used Agile Methodology**

* The most widely used adaptive methodology among Agile practitioners is **Scrum**.
* Scrum is known for its structured roles, time-boxed events, and iterative delivery model.
* It consistently ranks highest in adoption among teams using Agile methods, according to industry surveys.

### Common Alternatives and Complements to Scrum

* **Extreme Programming (XP):** frequent releases, strong focus on quality and responsiveness
* **Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe):** enterprise-level scaling of Agile practices
* **Kanban:** visual workflow with WIP limits, emphasizes steady flow
* **DSDM:** delivery-focused Agile framework with iterative delivery
* **Crystal:** lightweight methodology emphasizing people and interactions
* **Lean Software Development:** eliminates waste, focuses only on what the product needs

# Case Study: The Role of a Scrum Master

#### Estimated duration: 30 minutes

## Objectives:

* Review the scenario.
*
* Develop the case study for hiring a Scrum Master.
*
* List specific responsibilities a Scrum Master would have in Amazing Aerospace Inc.
*
* Define how each role could benefit the firm.
*
* Build a list of skills essential to Scrum Master success.
*

## Scenario

Amazing Aerospace Inc. produces advanced instrumentation for numerous spacecrafts, and interplanetary exploration equipment manufactured by major aerospace industries. The management wants the company to create new instrumentation and improve existing instruments to compete in a growing aerospace market.

The company recently hired over two hundred new employees. Among those are Product Managers, Project Managers, and development team professionals. Amazing Inc. plans to use a combination of traditional project management and Agile Scrum techniques to build its products.

Sal Mason is the Amazing Inc. CEO. He identifies and shares some company challenges with the new project management team. Here is his partial list:

1. Many new hires are experts in traditional project management methods. Unfortunately, they only have a general working knowledge of Agile and Scrum practices.
2. Most of the new development team members are conditioned to work autonomously. Integrating these skilled technical experts into a team will be a crucial challenge. Building a team may be more complicated based on the necessary functions or silos the organization employs out of necessity.
3. Sal notices during initial interviews that many new hires have a wide variety of opinions on how to organize and conduct daily operations. He notices that some share solid convictions and are outspoken.
4. Some new managers have had unpleasant experiences using Agile methodology in their previous organizations. One senior manager stated, 'Agile keeps management in the dark. Communication and collaboration are limited. Traditional project management is a better approach for what we want to accomplish.'
5. Senior management is debating the pertinence and needs of specific Product Owner and Scrum Master roles. Some managers suggest maintaining the traditional project management hierarchy and adding additional project and program managers.
6. Developers will encounter several technical challenges. Amazing's product line is highly technical, complex, and requires tremendous innovation. In addition, their leadership disagrees on optimal product specifications and key performance indicators.
7. Finally, Amazing has a highly diverse customer base. These customers often have incredibly diverse requirements that cannot be satisfied by a general product development process. Change is a fact in this industry, and the company must be flexible in addressing those changing requirements.
