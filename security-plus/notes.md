# CompTIA Security+ Study Notes

## Domain 1: Threats, Attacks, and Vulnerabilities

### 1.1 Types of Threat Actors

* **Script Kiddies**: Unskilled individuals using tools made by others.
* **Hacktivists**: Politically or socially motivated attackers.
* **Organized Crime**: Sophisticated, financially motivated attackers.
* **Nation-State/APT**: Highly skilled government-sponsored groups.
* **Insiders**: Threats originating within the organization.

### 1.2 Types of Attacks

* **Phishing**: Deceptive emails to trick users into giving up information.
* **Spear Phishing**: Targeted phishing aimed at specific individuals.
* **Whaling**: Phishing targeting high-profile individuals.
* **Vishing**: Phishing via voice call.
* **Smishing**: Phishing via SMS.
* **Credential Harvesting**: Collecting usernames/passwords.
* **Watering Hole**: Compromising a site commonly visited by targets.

### 1.3 Threat Vectors

* **Email attachments, websites, social engineering, USB devices**

## Domain 2: Architecture and Design

### 2.1 Secure Network Design

* **DMZ**: Public-facing services isolated from internal network.
* **Segmentation**: Dividing the network to limit attack spread.
* **Zero Trust**: Never trust, always verifyâ€”access is continuously validated.

### 2.2 Security Concepts

* **Least Privilege**: Users get only the access they need.
* **Defense in Depth**: Layered security controls.
* **Vendor Diversity**: Avoiding reliance on a single vendor for all solutions.

## Domain 3: Implementation

### 3.1 Secure Protocols

* **HTTPS**: Encrypted web traffic.
* **SSH**: Secure remote access.
* **SFTP**: Secure file transfer.
* **TLS/SSL**: Secure communication.
* **IPSec**: Secures IP traffic using authentication/encryption.

### 3.2 Endpoint Security

* **Antivirus, EDR, Application Whitelisting**

## Domain 4: Operations and Incident Response

### 4.1 Incident Response Process

* **Preparation**
* **Identification**
* **Containment**
* **Eradication**
* **Recovery**
* **Lessons Learned**

### 4.2 Tools

* **SIEM**: Collects and analyzes logs for threats.
* **SOAR**: Automates incident response workflows.
* **Syslog**: Standard logging format.

## Domain 5: Governance, Risk, and Compliance

### 5.1 Frameworks and Guidelines

* **NIST, ISO, COBIT, GDPR, HIPAA**

### 5.2 Risk Management

* **Risk Assessment**: Identifying and evaluating risks.
* **Risk Mitigation**: Reducing impact or likelihood of risks.

## Security Controls Overview

### Categories of Security Controls

**Technical Controls**: Implemented by technology (e.g., firewalls, antivirus, software policies).

**Managerial Controls**: Policies and procedures defined by management to guide secure system use (e.g., onboarding policies, compliance standards).

**Operational Controls**: Processes and activities carried out by people (e.g., guards, training, awareness posters).

**Physical Controls**: Devices or measures that prevent physical access (e.g., locks, fences, badge readers).

### Types of Control Functions

**Preventive Controls**: Stop incidents before they happen.

* *Examples:* Firewall rules (Technical), onboarding policy (Managerial), guard shack (Operational), door lock (Physical)

**Deterrent Controls**: Discourage potential attackers.

* *Examples:* Splash screen with security notice (Technical), threat of demotion (Managerial), reception desk (Operational), warning signs (Physical)

**Detective Controls**: Identify and log incidents.

* *Examples:* System logs (Technical), log reviews (Managerial), patrols (Operational), motion detectors (Physical)

**Corrective Controls**: Respond to and fix issues after detection.

* *Examples:* Backup restoration (Technical), incident reporting policies (Managerial), calling authorities (Operational), fire extinguisher (Physical)

**Compensating Controls**: Temporary solutions when primary controls can't be used.

* *Examples:* Firewall rule to mitigate unpatched vulnerability (Technical), separation of duties (Managerial), multiple guards (Operational), generator (Physical)

**Directive Controls**: Direct user actions through rules or training.

* *Examples:* Encrypted folder policies (Technical), compliance policies (Managerial), security training (Operational), "Authorized Personnel Only" signs (Physical)
